This mini project demonstrates how to create a responsive sidebar navigation menu using only HTML and CSS, without any JavaScript. The sidebar uses CSS transitions and the checkbox hack to toggle visibility, making it lightweight, fast, and beginner-friendly.

It highlights strong fundamentals in HTML structure, CSS positioning, and pure CSS interactivity.
